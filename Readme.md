Smash hit is a popular mobile based game on Android.
Here, I have tried to make a similar game on PC. It was done for a project in Graphics course at IIT Delhi, taught by Prof. Prem Kalra. 

All the implementation has been done in C++ using the OpenGL library. 

There is a "runGame.bat" file for executing the code.
