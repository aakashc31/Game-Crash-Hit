0. Restarting game not working properly
1. pause system //DONE
2. draw a single instance of each object, check working
3. high score system, and game ending condition
4. randomize texture, or for each set make different texture, that would look more realistic. 6 textures
5. if "mytime" b/w two clicks is == 0.01 then continue


*6. Implement a destruct function in each object, so that when the object is hit, there will be such an effect. Also we can include a sound.
